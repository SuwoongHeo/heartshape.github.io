# Proud
I never thought that this will ever happen. I hoped for it, but I never expected this. The mediator theme I ported is actually used by some one else and Iâ€™m very proud of this. My personal efforts that I have mainly done for my self are now helping other people creating their blog. But with this came also the responsibility to help others with their blog using the theme. I have lot of fun doing this. But in general I'm proud of my work.
